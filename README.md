# FurnXpert: Insulation Heat Analysis Application

Welcome to the FurnXpert repository! This project features a robust, decoupled full-stack web application designed to deliver a seamless experience. By separating the frontend and backend, we've ensured greater flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

## Project Structure


This repository is organized into two primary directories, each containing a core component of the FurnXpert application:

-   **[`frontend`](./frontend)**: This directory houses the client-side application, crafted with the latest web technologies for a dynamic and responsive user interface.

    -   **React 19**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

    -   **React Router 7**: For efficient client-side routing and navigation.

    -   **Vite 7**: A blazing fast build tool that significantly improves the development experience.

    -   **Shadcn UI**: A collection of beautiful and accessible UI components to accelerate development.

-   **[`backend`](./backend)**: Here you'll find the server-side API, built to handle all business logic, data processing, and database interactions.

    -   **.NET 9 Core Web API**: A high-performance, cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based web services.

    -   **Entity Framework Core**: An object-relational mapper (ORM) that simplifies database interactions.

    -   **Microsoft SQL Server**: A powerful and reliable relational database management system for robust data storage.



## Getting Started

To get FurnXpert up and running, you'll need to set up both the frontend and backend components. Each directory contains specific, detailed instructions to guide you through the process.

### Frontend Setup

Ready to explore the user interface? Navigate to the **[`frontend` directory](./frontend/README.md)** for comprehensive instructions on how to set up, build, and run the client-side application.

### Backend Setup

To power the application, you'll need to configure the backend API. Head over to the **[`backend` directory](./backend/README.md)** for detailed guidance on setting up the API, including database configuration and running migrations.
