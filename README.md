# Root README

This repository contains the decoupled codebase for FurnXpert full-stack web application. It is structured into two main directories:

-   [`frontend`](./frontend): Contains the client-side application built with React, React Router, Vite, and Shadcn UI.
-   [`backend`](./backend): Contains the server-side API built with .NET Core Web API, Entity Framework Core, and Microsoft SQL Server.
